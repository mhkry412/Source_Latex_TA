Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a 2D material with great potential in electronic, optoelectronic, and composite applications due to its thermal stability and unique insulating properties. This study investigates the electronic properties of a single-layer 2D hBN model with dimensions 6$\times$6$\times$1 that has been thermally heated. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using LAMMPS with the ReaxFF potential over a temperature range from 500 K to 4000 K. The evolution of the structure during the heating process was analyzed using the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). The final structure after heating was then converted using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to ensure compatibility with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations carried out with Quantum ESPRESSO. The electronic structure of the material was analyzed through Self-Consistent Field (SCF) and Non-Self-Consistent Field (NSCF) calculations to obtain the band structure, Density of States (DOS), Projected Density of States (PDOS), and charge distribution while considering spin-polarization effects. MD simulation results indicate that thermal heating induces significant changes in the atomic arrangement.
