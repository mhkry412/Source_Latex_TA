We ﬁnd that the non-monotonic behaviour of the lattice parameter, the expansion of the interatomic distance and the growth of the bending rigidity with temperature are qualitatively similar to those of graphene. Conversely, the energetics of point defects is extremely different: instead of Stone–Wales defects, the two lowest energy defects in h-BN involve either a broken bond or an out-of-plane displacement of a N atom to form a tetrahedron with three B atoms in the plane. We provide the formation energies and an estimate of the energy barriers.},

		Abstract

		Band structures for electrons, phonons, and other quasiparticles are often an important aspect of describing the physical properties of periodic solids. Most commonly, energy bands are computed along a one-dimensional path of high-symmetry points and line segments in reciprocal space (the “ k -path”), which are assumed to pass through important features of the dispersion landscape. However, existing methods for choosing this path rely on tabulated lists of high-symmetry points and line segments in the first Brillouin zone, determined using different symmetry criteria and unit cell conventions. Here we present a new “on-the-fly” symmetry-based approach to obtaining paths in reciprocal space that attempts to address the previous limitations of these conventions. Given a unit cell of a magnetic or nonmagnetic periodic solid, the site symmetry groups of points and line segments in the irreducible Brillouin zone are obtained from the total space group. The elements in these groups are used alongside general and maximally inclusive high-symmetry criteria to choose segments for the final k -path. A smooth path connecting each segment is obtained using graph theory. This new framework not only allows for increased flexibility and user convenience but also identifies notable overlooked features in certain electronic band structures. In addition, a more intelligent and efficient method for analyzing magnetic materials is also enabled through proper accommodation of magnetic symmetry.

In past years, a property-tunable strategy that involves the construction of electronic structures of h-BN through an atomic-level design of point defects has been in vogue. The point defects imported during material synthesis or functionalization by defect engineering can endow h-BN with new physical characteristics and applications. In this Perspective, we survey the current state of the art in multifunction variations induced by point defects for 2D h-BN. We begin with an introduction of the band structure and electronic property of the pristine h-BN. Subsequently, the formation and characterization of the most obvious point defects and their modulation in electronic structures of h-BN nanomaterials are envisaged in theory. The experimental results obtained by atom-resolved transmission electron microscopy, magnetic measurement, and optical measurements have provided insights into the point defect engineered structures and their corresponding emerging properties. Finally, we highlight the perspectives of h-BN nanomaterials for heterostructures and devices. This Perspective provides a landscape of the point defect physics involved to demonstrate the modulation of the structure and functionalities in h-BN and identify the roadmap for heterostructure and device applications, which will make advances in electronics, spintronics, and nanophotonics.},

	abstract     = {Due to similar atomic bonding and electronic structure to graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has broad application prospects such as the design of next generation energy efficient nano-electronic devices. Practical design and efficient performance of these devices based on h-BN nanostructures would require proper thermal characterization of h-BN nanostructures. Hence, in this study we have performed equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulation using an optimized Tersoff-type interatomic potential to model the thermal transport of nanometer sized zigzag hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (h-BNNRs). We have investigated the thermal conductivity of h-BNNRs as a function of temperature, length and width. Thermal conductivity of h-BNNRs shows strong temperature dependence. With increasing width, thermal conductivity increases while an opposite pattern is observed with the increase in length. Our study on h-BNNRs shows considerably lower thermal conductivity compared to GNRs. To elucidate these aspects, we have calculated phonon density of states for both h-BNNRs and GNRs. Moreover, using EMD we have explored the impact of different vacancies, namely, point vacancy, edge vacancy and bi-vacancy on the thermal conductivity of h-BNNRs. With varying percentages of vacancies, significant reduction in thermal conductivity is observed and it is found that, edge and point vacancies are comparatively more destructive than bi-vacancies. Such study would contribute further into the growing interest for accurate thermal transport characterization of low dimensional nanostructures.},

	abstract     = {Twisted moiré supercells, which can be approximated as a combination of sliding bilayers and constitute various topologically nontrivial polarization patterns, attract extensive attention recently. However, because of the excessive size of the moiré supercell, most studies are based on effective models and lack the results of first-principles calculation. In this work, we use machine learning to determine the topological structure of the polarization pattern in twisted and strained bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We further confirm that the topological pattern can be effectively modulated by the vertical electric field and lattice mismatch. Finally, local polarization also exists in the antiparallel stacked h-BN twisted and strained bilayers. Our work provides a detailed study of the polarization pattern in the moiré superlattice, which we believe can facilitate more research in moiré ferroelectricity, topological physics, and related fields.},

Whereas the micromechanical exfoliation technique has been adopted for rapid material characterization and demonstration of innovative device ideas based on these 2D systems, signiﬁcant advances have recently been made in large-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous growth of these materials. This review reﬂects recent progress and outlines future prospects of these novel 2D materials. We provide a holistic overview of the different synthesis and characterization techniques, electronic and photonic device characteristics, and catalytic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides and their heterostructures. We also comment on the challenges that need to be overcome for full-scale commercial implementation of this novel class of layered materials.},

Arguments to support this view are presented, and a semiempirical exchange‐correlation functional containing local‐spin‐density, gradient, and exact‐exchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8 proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first‐ and second‐row systems. This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.},
